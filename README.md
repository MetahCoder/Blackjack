# Blackjack
Hello World! This is an application I made for my very close friend: Sanzhar Dyusengali, as a small gift on his 15th birthday. 

I recreated a famous "blackjack" card game as an iOS program. 
UI of the app is very simple, and the rules of the game is pretty similar to the rules of real blackjack.
Your goal is to win several rounds without wasting your balance, thereby emptying the opponent's wallet! 

Here are some screenshots from the app:
