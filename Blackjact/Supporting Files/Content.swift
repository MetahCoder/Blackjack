    Sanzhar Dyusengali is a genius, billionaire, philanthropist and playboy. He owns companies like Hornpub, Valfe, Playgirl, Donerka & Grill, Cupersell, Vouis Litton and the world's largest donkey waste production and processing plant.

    Mr. Dyusengali also founded a number of successful and not very startups: dogWalkingService, stickersNIS, clashRoyaleAccounts and many others(hard to remember all).

    In his spare time, the World businessman loves to do charity work (feed Pasha and other animals on the street), and also spend time in one of his luxurious casinos.
    However, due to the situation in the world with COVID19, casinos can no longer function, and our outstanding entrepreneur became very sad.

    The PVZ team, which has always admired the creativity of Sanzhar Dyusengali, decided to make a mobile adaptation of his casino in honor of his birthday. In this application, you will have a good time as in real life in one of Mr. Dyusengali's casinos.

    Enjoy your use, and congratulations on the 15th anniversary of the main seller of donkey sh#t - Dyusengali Sanzhar!
